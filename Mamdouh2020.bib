abstract = {This paper presents the possibility of converting (2D) medical image data (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) files) to 3D model. Medical data and image processing software's, namely Seg3D2 and ImageVis3D, were used to analyze images, create 3D models of the liver and export them in OBJ images for performing a range of surgical procedures, and measure the accuracy of the size and weight of the liver, kidneys and arteries with their conformity to DICOM file. It is compared to the image processing before and after the conversion stage of medical image using the Python language program to ensure the integrity of the images after the conversion process is identical to the original pictures of DICOM without causing any distortions or changes to it. We reduce file size while maintaining the model's highest quality, while employing mixed reality techniques, applied on Liver Surgical Operation [living donor liver Transplantation (LDLT)].},
